# Nand2Tetris

## Building a Modern Computer From First Principles
--------------------------------------------------
These are my completed projects for Nand2Tetris, which aims to build a computer starting with a Nand gate and working my way up to an operating system. So far I have completed the following:

1. Implemented basic chips using a hardware description language - Not, And, Or, Xor, Mux, DMux, Not16, And16, Or16, Mux16, Or8Way, Mux4Way16, Mux8Way16, DMux4Way, DMux8Way

2. Implemented a HalfAdder, FullAdder, Add16, Inc16, and ALU with status outputs (negative and zero) in HDL

3. Given a data flip flop, implemented a 1-bit register, 16-bit register, RAM8, RAM64, RAM512, RAM4K, RAM16K, and a Program Counter in HDL

4. Wrote a program that multiplies two integers as well as a program that fills all of a screen's pixels with black when a keyboard key is pressed, both written in an assembly language.
